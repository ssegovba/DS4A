# Data Science for All (DS4A) code examples
This repo contains examples of codes in which I worked on during my enrollment as a DS4A fellow in 2021.

The `python_codes` folder contains examples of problem sets every fellow had to work on in the DS4A program. These showcase skills on exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques ML, while using libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `sklearn` and `nltk`.

The `capstone_project` folder contains a piece of code I worked on for determining the benefits of using a logistic regression model as a classification tool to identify employees resignations. This code was part of a greater project, which tried to search for determinants for employees resignations using decision trees, random forest and neural network models.
