    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** The city of New York has seen a rise in the number of accidents on the roads in the city. They would like to know if the number of accidents have increased in the last few weeks. For all the reported accidents, they have collected details for each accident and have been maintaining records for the past year and a half (from January 2018 to August 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "The city has contracted you to build visualizations that would help them identify patterns in accidents, which would help them take preventive actions to reduce the number of accidents in the future. They have certain parameters like borough, time of day, reason for accident, etc. Which they care about and which they would like to get specific information on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your task is to format the given data and provide visualizations that would answer the specific questions the client has, which are mentioned below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** You are given a CSV file (stored in the already created ```data``` folder) containing details about each accident like date, time, location of the accident, reason for the accident, types of vehicles involved, injury and death count, etc. The delimiter in the given CSV file is `;` instead of the default `,`. You will be performing the following tasks on the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract additional borough data stored in a JSON file\n",
    "2. Read, transform, and prepare data for visualization\n",
    "3. Perform analytics and construct visualizations of the data to identify patterns in the dataset\n",
    "        \n",
    "The client has a specific set of questions they would like to get answers to. You will need to provide visualizations to accompany these:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How have the number of accidents fluctuated over the past year and a half? Have they increased over the time?\n",
    "2. For any particular day, during which hours are accidents most likely to occur?\n",
    "3. Are there more accidents on weekdays than weekends?\n",
    "4. What are the accidents count-to-area ratio per borough? Which boroughs have disproportionately large numbers of accidents for their size?\n",
    "5. For each borough, during which hours are accidents most likely to occur?\n",
    "6. What are the top 5 causes of accidents in the city? \n",
    "7. What types of vehicles are most involved in accidents per borough?\n",
    "8. What types of vehicles are most involved in deaths?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To solve this extended case, please read the function docstrings **very carefully**. They contain information that you will need! Also, please don't include `print()` statements inside your functions (they will most likely produce an error in the test cells). Finally, for the purposes of this case, do not worry about standardizing text variables - for example, treat `taxi` and `Taxi` as though they were different values (you will learn how to standardize text later on in the program)."

This could be attributed to the fact that during those months the city has fewer residents because they are traveling for the holidays. As for the lowest point in the series (August 2019) this could be explained because not every day on the month is included on the data base, so the comparison with the other months could be misleading."

    "In a 2018 [interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/nyregion/traffic-deaths-decrease-nyc.html) with The New York Times, New York's mayor de Blasio stated that \"*Vision Zero is clearly working*\". That year, the number of deaths in traffic accidents in NYC dropped to a historically low 202. Yet, as reported by [am New York Metro](https://www.amny.com/news/vision-zero-de-blasio-1-30707464/), the number of fatalities has increased by 30% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the previous year and the number of pedestrians and cyclists injured has not seen any improvement.\n",

    "A. Consider the accidents of the first quarter of 2019. Then, check for the most common causes of accidents where pedestrians and cyclists were involved. Give a recommendation based solely on this information.<br>\n",
    "B. Create a pair of heat maps of the accidents involving injured/killed pedestrians and cyclists in the first quarter of 2018 and 2019. Compare these two to see if there is any change in the concentration of accidents. In critical areas, study the type of factors involved in the accidents. Give a recommendation to visit these areas to study the problem further.<br>\n",

    "In my opinion, the option that best describes what we should do is **B**. It is clear that in order to understand the increase of fatalities during the first quarter of 2019 we must have a base of comparison. In this sense, using the 2018 first quarter data seems reasonable, and could provide further insights on the observed changes. In particular, we could identify potential boroughs where the *Vision Zero* policies should be more focused, or even identify if the phenomena is something more general around all of New York City.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, I think that it is also worth noting that, although every human life count as unique and valuable, giving an idea of how useful a public policy is in terms of absolute values -that is in term of total fatalities-, could be misleading sometimes. For example, in spite of the increase of the total number of casualties, the relative proportion of deaths compared to the total of cyclist/pedestrians in the city could be lower."
